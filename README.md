Restraunt Dating app
<br>
Businesses sign up their restraunt but providing us with basic information. Name, location, summary, photo. <br>
Users then review the restraunt by adding comments and telling us if it is a positive or negative comment. <br>
Using their comments we recomend other people with similar comments to them on the same restraunts. <br>
